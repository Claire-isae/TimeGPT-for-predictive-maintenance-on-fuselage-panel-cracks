The programs were runned under Python 3.8.13 
A key is needed from Nixtla to run the forecast on TimeGPT, here after the website to create an account: https://dashboard.nixtla.io/ 
 
 
FILES : 
 
main.py : is the file used to create a data base 
crack.py : is the file with the physics functions used by "main.py" 
utils.py : is the file with the functions to structure the data set 
TImeGPT_forecast.py : is the filed to do SIMPLE forecasts and FINE-TUNED forecasts 
TimeGPT_exogenous_variables.py : is the file to do forecasts with EXOGENOUS VARIABLES 
Illustration_CaseStudy_personnalise_pure.py : is the filed to run to show the graph with the curves of each gauge 
 
 
TUTORIAL : 
 
1- Run "main.py" 
2- Run "Illustration_CaseStudy_personnalise_pure.py" to show the curves 
3- In the forecast files, copy your API key from Nixtla, the line is in the IMPORTS 
4- Run "TImeGPT_forecast.py" or "TimeGPT_exogenous_variables.py"
